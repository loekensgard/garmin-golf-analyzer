# Garmin Golf Shot Analyzer - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that helps golfers identify and fix incorrectly tracked shots in Garmin Connect. This tool scans your golf scorecards to find suspicious shots that are likely GPS errors or tracking bugs, such as putts recorded at 60+ meters, wedge shots at unrealistic distances and other clubs with way too long distances.

Made because finding these shots in the Garmin app or on the web is a hassle. Instead of checking every scorecard manually, this script will do it for you. 

## Problem It Solves

Garmin golf watches sometimes record incorrect shot distances due to:
- GPS signal issues
- Accidental button presses
- Auto-shot detection errors
- Syncing problems

These errors affect your club statistics, and if using one of the Approach watches, the virtual caddy will use these statistics to suggest clubs. This extension helps you quickly find and review these problematic shots so you can correct them in Garmin Connect.

### Default Detection Rules

The extension uses these default maximum distances (in meters):

| Club Type | Max Distance | Common Issues |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Driver | 350m | GPS glitches on tee shots |
| 3 Wood | 280m | Auto-detection errors |
| Irons (5-9) | 200-170m | Wrong club selected |
| Wedges (PW/SW/LW) | 150-120m | Chip shots marked as full swings |
| **Putter** | **20m** | **Most common error - GPS jumps** |

## Common Scenarios

### Putter Showing 60+ Meters
**Most common issue!** This happens when:
- GPS signal is lost in woods/buildings
- Watch auto-detects a practice swing as real shot
- You forget to mark the shot and GPS jumps to next tee

### Wedge Showing 180+ Meters
Usually occurs when:
- Wrong club is selected on watch
- Shot detection triggers during cart ride
- GPS correction happens mid-round
